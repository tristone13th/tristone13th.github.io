### 疑问词 + 不定式

由于不定式和情态动词都是表不确定的语气，不定式也由情态动词演化而来，所以我们首先从情态动词的角度出发来考虑这个句式。

由于以特殊疑问词开头，对句中某一成分提问的句子为特殊疑问句。当为特殊疑问句时：

- 如[疑问词](https://baike.baidu.com/item/疑问词)作主语或主语的定语，即对主语或主语的定语提问，其语序是[陈述](https://baike.baidu.com/item/陈述)句语序；

   > Whose bike is broken?

- 如疑问词作其他成分，即对其他成分提问，其[语序](https://baike.baidu.com/item/语序)是：特殊疑问词+[一般疑问句](https://baike.baidu.com/item/一般疑问句)（be/[助动词](https://baike.baidu.com/item/助动词)/[情态动词](https://baike.baidu.com/item/情态动词)+[主语](https://baike.baidu.com/item/主语)+[谓语](https://baike.baidu.com/item/谓语)）

  > How can I speak English?

对于第二种，情态动词can代表了一种不确定的语气在里面，所以我们可以进行省略，也就是：

How to speak English?

### 不可数名词 + 三单

不可数名词后应当跟第三人称单数。

### No one, nobody, nothing, nowhere 后接单数

**Nobody** ever goes to see her. She’s very lonely. 

You usually have to wait for a long time. **Nothing** happens quickly. 

There was **nowhere** to park the car.[^2]

### Zero + 复数

Zero 表示 not any，所以后面是可数名词时要加复数。

### Also 后面要加什么

Also 是副词，对动词形式没有影响，所以有 also 没有 also 都是一样的，后面不需要必须加动词原形。

### Which 引导的名词从句后面三单与否视指代的名词而定

> A wide-range of new applications and services for 5G are emerging, such as real-time online gaming, virtual reality (VR) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) video streaming, **which require** unprecedented high access speed and low latency.

### Everyone has their...

"Everyone" is considered singular. However, when we don't know if the subject is male or female we can use "they" (and therefore "their"). So, your first sentence ("Everyone has their dream") is correct. I would also say that "Everyone has his/her dream" is correct. To say "Everyone has his dream" is also correct, though slightly politically incorrect these days.[^1]
