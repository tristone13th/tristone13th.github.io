### Why some functions are prefixed with `qemu`?

Wrapped version of standard library or GLib functions use a `qemu_` prefix to alert readers that they are seeing a wrapped version, for example `qemu_strtol` or `qemu_mutex_lock`. Other utility functions that are widely called from across the codebase should not have any prefix, for example `pstrcpy` or bit manipulation functions such as `find_first_bit`.
