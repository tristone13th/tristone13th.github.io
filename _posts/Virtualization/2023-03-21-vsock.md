Let **guest applications** can communicate with **host applications**.

Use POSIX Sockets API: A new socket family `AF_VSOCK` is hereby introduced.

This can be used to implement **hypervisor services** and **guest agents**.

### Limitation of virtio-serial

N:1 connections are clunky over 1:1 serial port

- Applications have to multiplex over 1 stream
- Libvirt has to arbitrate access between qemu-guest-agent clients
Relatively low number of ports available (~512)
- Limit is hardcoded by host
Stream semantics (no message boundaries)
- Ugly for datagram protocols

Applications must use character devices instead of familiar sockets API…

### CID

You can think it like the IP address.

The host and each VM have a 32 bit CID (Context IDentifier) and may connect or bind to a 32 bit port number.

### Virtio-vsock / Vhost-vsock-pci

virtio-vsock is a vhost-based virtio device.

Both `virtio-vsock` and `vhost-vsock-pci` are virtual socket devices used to facilitate communication between a virtual machine and the host system in a virtualized environment. However, there are some differences between them.

`Virtio-vsock` is a virtual socket device that uses the **virtio** framework. It is designed to be efficient and secure, with minimal CPU overhead and strong isolation between the guest and host systems.

On the other hand, `vhost-vsock-pci` is a virtual socket device that uses the **vhost** framework, which is a Linux kernel module used for virtio-based virtualization. Vhost-vsock-pci is a more recent addition to the Linux kernel, it is specifically designed to work with the PCI bus, which may provide some performance advantages in certain scenarios.

In summary, Virtio-vsock uses the virtio framework, while vhost-vsock-pci uses the vhost framework and is specifically designed to work with the PCI bus.

### VSock Example

```bash
sudo modprobe vhost_vsock
```

To create a VM with a vsock device with CID 123:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -device vhost-vsock-pci,guest-cid=123
```

Example of guest as client, host as server: [vsock notes](https://gist.github.com/nrdmn/7971be650919b112343b1cb2757a3fe6) (Note, guest can also be the server and host as the client, see the comment here).
