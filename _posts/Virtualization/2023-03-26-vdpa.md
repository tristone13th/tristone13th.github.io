vDPA (virtio data path acceleration) is a kernel framework (vhost) which enables NIC vendors to integrate their vDPA NIC kernel drivers into the framework.

A “vDPA device” means a type of device whose **data path** complies with the virtio specification, but whose **control path** is vendor specific.
