### Misc ideas

Some instructions are conditionally exiting instructions, which means they will exit only some conditions are met. See the "Conditionally Exiting Instructions" section in [Day 5: VM-exit handler, Event Injection, and CPUID Emulation](https://revers.engineering/day-5-vmexits-interrupts-cpuid-emulation/)

### SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGKILL

**SIGINT** is the signal sent when we press Ctrl+C. The default action is to terminate the process. However, some programs override this action and handle it differently. One common example is the bash interpreter. When we press Ctrl+C it doesn’t quit, instead, it prints a new and empty prompt line.

If we want to use a signal to terminate it, we can’t use **SIGINT** with this script. We should use **SIGTERM**, **SIGQUIT**, or **SIGKILL** instead.

**SIGTERM** is the default signal when we use the kill command. The default action of both signals is to terminate the process. However, **SIGQUIT** also generates a core dump before exiting. When we send **SIGTERM**, the process sometimes executes a clean-up routine before exiting. We can also handle **SIGTERM** to ask for confirmation before exiting.

When a process receives SIGKILL it is terminated. This is a special signal as it can’t be ignored and we can’t change its behavior.

The default action for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, and SIGKILL is to terminate the process. However

- SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, and SIGKILL are defined as signals to terminate the process,
- but SIGINT is defined as an interruption requested by the user. So, we shouldn’t depend solely on SIGINT to finish a process.

### QMP reference

[QEMU QMP Reference Manual — QEMU documentation](https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/interop/qemu-qmp-ref.html)

### KVM_SET_CPUID2

KVM forbids KVM_SET_CPUID2 after KVM_RUN was performed on a vCPU unless the supplied CPUID data is equal to what was previously set.

[[PATCH v4 5/5] KVM: selftests: Test KVM_SET_CPUID2 after KVM_RUN — Linux KVM](https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg265159.html)

**What will happen when we set an unsupported CPUID to KVM?**

### Host and guest share folder in QEMU

Using Samba.

### QEMU redirect guest output to host console

```bash
-chardev stdio,id=virtiocon0 \ # Backend, Connects the chardev virtiocon0 with the qemu process' stdin/out.
-device virtio-serial \ # channel
-device virtconsole,chardev=virtiocon0 # front-end
```

`virtio-serial` simply creates a communication channel between host and guest. This is necessary for the next driver.

The last one, `virtconsole` creates a **console device** on the guest, attached to the `chardev` created before, which was attached to qemu's stdio/out. The guest can then use this console device like any other tty.

The device created on the guest will depend on the kernel and how it was compiled, in linux it's usually `/dev/hvc0`.

### Instruction fetches and data access

**Who perform the instruction fetch?**

It is performed automatically, An instruction fetch is user-mode if CPL = 3 and is supervisor mode if CPL < 3. Instruction fetches are always performed with linear addresses (RIP is linear address).

I think an **user mode instruction fetch** indicates that we are running user space programs, **a supervisor mode instruction fetch** indicates that we may running in the kernel space.

### KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID

```c
struct kvm_cpuid2 {
      __u32 nent;
      __u32 padding;
      struct kvm_cpuid_entry2 entries[0];
};

#define KVM_CPUID_FLAG_SIGNIFCANT_INDEX               BIT(0)
#define KVM_CPUID_FLAG_STATEFUL_FUNC          BIT(1) /* deprecated */
#define KVM_CPUID_FLAG_STATE_READ_NEXT                BIT(2) /* deprecated */

struct kvm_cpuid_entry2 {
      __u32 function;
      __u32 index;
      __u32 flags;
      __u32 eax;
      __u32 ebx;
      __u32 ecx;
      __u32 edx;
      __u32 padding[3];
};
```

What does each bit in eax (ebx, ecx, edx) mean? There are 2 meanings:

The **first** explanation:

- If the bit returned is 1, it means this bit **could** be set as 1;
- If the bit returned is 0, it means this bit **must** be set as 0;

The **second** explanation:

- If the bit returned is 1, it means this bit **must** be set as 1;
- If the bit returned is 0, it means this bit **must** be set as 0;

According to the code:

```c
// kvm_arch_dev_ioctl
// kvm_dev_ioctl_get_cpuid
// get_cpuid_func
// do_cpuid_func
// __do_cpuid_func
// do_host_cpuid
// cpuid_count
void cpuid_count(u32 id, u32 count, u32 *a, u32 *b, u32 *c, u32 *d)
{
	asm volatile("cpuid"
		     : "=a" (*a), "=b" (*b), "=c" (*c), "=d" (*d)
		     : "0" (id), "2" (count)
	);
}
```

So it just the output from the host. So I prefer to the **first** explanation.

### 64-bit Process virtual address space

The 64-bit x86 virtual memory map splits the address space into two:

- the lower section (with the top bit set to 0) is user-space,
- the upper section (with the top bit set to 1) is kernel-space.

{
	/* Note: a barrier is implicit in alternative() */
	alternative("", __ASM_CLAC, X86_FEATURE_SMAP);

### Kernel patching / text poking

Kernel deliberately initialized a temporary mm area within the **lower half of the address range** for text poking, see commit 4fc19708b165 ("x86/alternatives: Initialize temporary mm for patching").

**Why?**

### ESP (EFI System Partition)

The EFI system partition (also called ESP) is an **OS independent partition** that acts as the storage place for the EFI bootloaders, applications and drivers to be launched by the UEFI firmware. It is mandatory for UEFI boot.

Typical mount points:

- mount ESP to `/boot`. This is the most straightforward method.
- mount ESP to `/efi`.
- …

Tip:

- `/efi` is a replacement[5] for the historical and now discouraged ESP mountpoint `/boot/efi`.

[EFI system partition - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition)

**How to see current mount point?**

Typically, the EFI partition is mounted as `/boot/efi`.

**Size of the ESP**

It is not fixed.

As per the Arch Linux wiki, to avoid potential problems with some EFIs, ESP size should be at least 512 MiB. 550 MiB is recommended to avoid MiB/MB confusion and accidentally creating FAT16. So, most common size guideline for EFI System Partition is between 100 MB to 550 MB.

### x86_emulate_ops, KVM instruction emulator, how does KVM emulate an instruction?

Handle process:

[Day 5: VM-exit handler, Event Injection, and CPUID Emulation](https://revers.engineering/day-5-vmexits-interrupts-cpuid-emulation/)

![](https://i0.wp.com/revers.engineering/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-Diagram3.png?resize=653%2C244&ssl=1)

The place to advance VMX_GUEST_RIP: `skip_emulated_instruction()` in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c`.

The flow chart for handling an instruction: [KVM Emulate Flowchart](https://gist.github.com/JonathonReinhart/fdd25b716d1c567b056a6c3bb39c5807), there are some faults in it.

If you search in Google what is KVM instruction emulator, you will get **NOTHING**.

```c
kvm_emulate_instruction
	x86_emulate_instruction
```

Operations in `x86_emulate_ops` represent the **instruction emulator**'s interface to memory.

This ops is defined in `arch/x86/kvm/kvm_emulate.h`. Like other ops, there is a global instance `emulate_ops`:

```c
static const struct x86_emulate_ops emulate_ops = {
	//...
}
```

这里定义的函数没有通过 static_call 来调用，而是直接 indirect call 来调用。

Difference with the ops with the prefix `kvm`, such as `kvm_x86_ops`? I don't know.

### KVM_MP_STATE_*

x86 支持哪些 `KVM_MP_STATE_*`?

```c
// 支持的
#define KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE          0
#define KVM_MP_STATE_UNINITIALIZED     1

// 不确定的
#define KVM_MP_STATE_INIT_RECEIVED     2
#define KVM_MP_STATE_HALTED            3
#define KVM_MP_STATE_SIPI_RECEIVED     4
#define KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED           5
#define KVM_MP_STATE_CHECK_STOP        6
#define KVM_MP_STATE_OPERATING         7
#define KVM_MP_STATE_LOAD              8
#define KVM_MP_STATE_AP_RESET_HOLD     9
#define KVM_MP_STATE_SUSPENDED         10
```

### KVM VCPU Requests

An **internal** API enabling threads (Kernel) to request a VCPU thread to perform some activity. For example, a thread may request a VCPU to flush its TLB. The API consists of the following **functions**:

[KVM VCPU Requests — The Linux Kernel documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/virt/kvm/vcpu-requests.html)

```c
struct kvm_vcpu {
	//...
	u64 requests;
	//...
}
```

We can notice that `request` is architecture-agnostic, it is a KVM-only concept.

When each time we `vcpu_enter_guest` (**before** the actual code we enter into the non-root mode), we will check if there are pending requests by `kvm_request_pending`, if so, we will handle them.

### vcpu_block()

当 guest 执行 hlt 指令后会发生 VM Exit（不能让 vCPU 在非根模式下 hlt，这样会浪费 CPU 资源）。

```
kvm_emulate_halt (the vmexit handler)
	kvm_emulate_halt_noskip
		 __kvm_emulate_halt
			vcpu->arch.mp_state = KVM_MP_STATE_HALTED; // this can help us in vcpu_run(), we will execute vcpu_block()
```

**Why there are `kvm_vcpu_halt` and `kvm_vcpu_block`?**

```c
static inline int vcpu_block(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
		//...
		// guest execute halt and we want to halt polling mechanism
		if (vcpu->arch.mp_state == KVM_MP_STATE_HALTED)
			kvm_vcpu_halt(vcpu);
		// In some situations, KVM want to simply block the vcpu
		else
			kvm_vcpu_block(vcpu);
		//...
}
```

### Rep; nop

**`rep; nop` is indeed the same as the `pause` instruction** (opcode F390). It might be used for assemblers which don't support the pause instruction yet. On previous processors, this simply did nothing, just like `nop` but in two bytes. On new processors which support hyperthreading, it is used as a hint to the processor that you are executing a spinloop to increase performance.

[What does "rep; nop;" mean in x86 assembly? Is it the same as the "pause" instruction? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7086220/what-does-rep-nop-mean-in-x86-assembly-is-it-the-same-as-the-pause-instru)

### `PAUSE` Instruction

当 spinlock 执行 lock () 获得锁失败后会进行 busy loop，不断检测锁状态，尝试获得锁。这么做有一个缺陷：频繁的检测会让流水线上充满了读操作。另外一个线程往流水线上丢入一个锁变量写操作的时候，必须对流水线进行重排，**因为 CPU 必须保证所有读操作读到正确的值**。流水线重排十分耗时，影响 lock () 的性能。

为了解决这个问题，Intel 发明了 **pause** 指令。这个指令的本质功能：让加锁失败时 CPU 睡眠 30 个（about）clock，从而使得读操作的频率低很多。流水线重排的代价也会小很多。

[为什么SpinLock的实现中应该加上PAUSE指令？ - xinyuyuanm - 博客园](https://www.cnblogs.com/xinyuyuanm/archive/2013/04/03/2998585.html)

[自旋锁 spinlock 剖析与改进_知识库_博客园](https://kb.cnblogs.com/page/105657/)

Improves the performance of spin-wait loops. When executing a “spin-wait loop,” processors will suffer a severe performance penalty when exiting the loop because it detects a possible **memory order violation**. The PAUSE instruction provides a hint to the processor that the code sequence is a spin-wait loop. The processor uses this hint to avoid the memory order violation in most situations, which greatly improves processor performance. For this reason, it is recommended that a PAUSE instruction be placed in all spin-wait loops.

### SMAP (Supervisor mode access prevention)

Motivation: Protecting **user space** from the **kernel**.

This extension defines a new SMAP bit in the CR4 control register; when that bit is set, any attempt to access user-space memory while running in a privileged mode will lead to a page fault.

[Supervisor mode access prevention [LWN.net]](https://lwn.net/Articles/517475/)

From Intel SDM:

>CR4.SMAP allows pages to be protected from supervisor-mode data accesses. If CR4.SMAP = 1, software operating in supervisor mode cannot access data at linear addresses that are accessible in user mode. Software can override this protection by setting EFLAGS.AC. Section 4.6 explains how access rights are determined, including the definition of supervisor-mode accesses and user-mode accessibility.

### SMEP (Supervisor-Mode Execution Prevention)

From Intel SDM:

>CR4.SMEP allows pages to be protected from supervisor-mode instruction fetches. If CR4.SMEP = 1, software operating in supervisor mode cannot fetch instructions from linear addresses that are accessible in user mode. Section 4.6 explains how access rights are determined, including the definition of supervisor-mode accesses and user-mode accessibility.

### TIF_NEED_RESCHED

TIF_NEED_RESCHED is set to signal that a, usually currently running, task needs to be re-scheduled so that the core the task is running on, becomes available for other tasks. In other words: the TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is set if it has been determine that the task has used its time slice and should be preempted. For reasons, setting the flag and actually preempting the task is done at two different occasions and points in time. For example the flag may be set in an interrupted handler but the actually re-scheduling is done at a later point.
