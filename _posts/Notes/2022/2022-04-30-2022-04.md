### 特权指令与敏感指令 / Sensitive instructions and privilege instructions

大多数的现代计算机体系结构都有两个或以上的特权级，用来分隔系统软件和应用软件。系统中有一些操作和管理关键系统资源的指令会被定为特权指令，这些指令只有在**最高特权级**上能够正确执行。如果在非最高特权级上运行，特权指令会引发一个异常，处理器会陷入到最高特权级，交由系统软件来处理。

在不同的特权级上，不仅指令的执行效果是不同的，而且也并不是每个特权指令都会引发异常，假如一个 x86 平台的用户违反了规范，在用户态修改 EFLAGS 寄存器的中断开关位，这一修改将不会产生任何效果，也不会引起异常陷入，而是会被硬件直接忽略掉。

在虚拟化世界里，还有另一类指令被称作为敏感指令，简言之就是操作特权资源的指令，包括修改虚拟机的运行模式或者下面物理机的状态；读写敏感的寄存器或是内存，例如时钟或者中断寄存器；访问存储保护系统、内存系统或是地址重定位系统；以及所有的 I/O 指令。

**敏感指令是 Guest 执行了之后会引发 VMExit 的指令。**

显而易见，所有的特权指令都是敏感指令，然而并不是所有的敏感指令都是特权指令。

### C-State / P-State

C-states are idle power saving states, in contrast to P-states, which are execution power saving states.

During a P-state, the processor is still executing instructions, whereas during a C-state (other than C0), the processor is idle, meaning that nothing is executing.

A new CPU driver intel_pstate was added to the Linux kernel 3.9 (April 2009).

When a logical processor is idle (C-state except of C0), its frequency is typically 0 (HALT).

CPU cores can be completely turned off (CPU HALT, frequency of 0) temporarily to reduce the power consumption, and the frequency of cores changes regulary depending on many factors like the workload and temperature.

The processor P-state is the capability of running the processor at different voltage and/or frequency levels. Generally, P0 is the highest state resulting in maximum performance, while P1, P2, and so on, will save power but at some penalty to CPU performance.

Turbo Boost allows to run one or many CPU cores to higher P-states than usual. The maximum P-state is constrained by the following factors:

The number of active cores (in C0 or C1 state)

The estimated current consumption of the processor (Imax)

The estimated power consumption (TDP - Thermal Design Power) of processor

The temperature of the processor

It looks like the most reliable way to get a relialistic estimation of the CPUs frequency is to use the tool turbostat.

Typically, they are used along with algorithms to estimate the required CPU capacity, so as to decide which P-states to put the CPUs into. Of course, since the utilization of the system generally changes over time, that has to be done repeatedly on a regular basis. The activity by which this happens is referred to as CPU performance scaling or CPU frequency scaling.

### Most ioctl implementations consist of a switch statement. It selects the correct behavior according to the cmd argument.

### Tampermonkey

This plugin can add Javascript scripts to any site, so I can replace some characters in title to enhance the copy as markdown style feature.

### Magic number

**motivation**:

Before writing the code for ioctl, you need to choose the numbers that correspond to commands. Unfortunately, the simple choice of using small numbers starting from 1 and going up doesn’t work well. **The command numbers should be unique across the system.** In order to prevent errors caused by issuing the right command to the wrong device.[^1]

Two device nodes may have the same major number. An application could open more than one device and mix up the file descriptors, thereby sending the right command to the wrong device. Sending wrong ioctl commands can have catastrophic consequences, including damage to hardware. A unique magic number should be encoded into the commands with one of the following macros.[^2]

```c
_IO (magic, number)
_IOR (magic, number, data_type)
_IOW (magic, number, data_type)
_IORW(magic, number, data_type)
```

where magic is the 8-bit magic number unique to the **device**.

### Ioctl for block device

Block devices can provide an *ioctl* method to perform device control functions. The higher-level block subsystem code intercepts a number of *ioctl* commands before your driver ever gets to see them, however (see *drivers/block/ioctl.c* in the kernel source for the full set). In fact, a modern block driver may not have to implement very many *ioctl* commands at all.[^3]

### Core difference between char device and block device

Character devices are those for which no buffering is performed, and block devices are those which are accessed through a cache.

Character devices are read from and written to with two function: `foo_read()` and `foo_write()`. The `read()` and `write()` calls do not return until the operation is complete. By contrast, block devices do not even implement the `read()` and `write()` functions, and instead have a function which has historically been called the ``strategy routine.'' Reads and writes are done through the buffer cache mechanism by the generic functions `bread(),` `breada(),` and `bwrite()`. These functions go through the buffer cache, and so may or may not actually call the strategy routine, depending on whether or not the block requested is in the buffer cache (for reads) or on whether or not the buffer cache is full (for writes). A request may be asyncronous: `breada()` can request the strategy routine to schedule reads that have not been asked for, and to do it asyncronously, in the background, in the hopes that they will be needed later.

The sources for character devices are kept in drivers/char/, and the sources for block devices are kept in drivers/block/. They have similar interfaces, and are very much alike, except for reading and writing. Because of the difference in reading and writing, initialization is different, as block devices have to register a strategy routine, which is registered in a different way than the `foo_read()` and `foo_write()` routines of a character device driver.[^4]

### Remote tracking branch

Remote-tracking branches are references to the state of remote branches. They’re local references that **you can’t move**; Git moves them for you whenever you do any network communication, to make sure they accurately represent the state of the remote repository.

### Kernel develop commit pretty format

The following `git config` settings can be used to add a pretty format for outputting the above style in the `git log` or `git show` commands:

```
[core]
        abbrev = 12
[pretty]
        fixes = Fixes: %h (\"%s\")
```

An example call:

```
$ git log -1 --pretty=fixes 54a4f0239f2e
Fixes: 54a4f0239f2e ("KVM: MMU: make kvm_mmu_zap_page() return the number of pages it actually freed")
```

### Linux coding style notes

- Outside of comments, documentation and except in Kconfig, spaces are never used for indentation.
- The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a strongly preferred limit.
- never break user-visible strings such as printk messages, because that breaks the ability to grep for them.

### Why doesn't lua support POSIX regular expression?

Unlike several other scripting languages, Lua does not use POSIX regular expressions (regexp) for pattern matching. The main reason for this is size: A typical implementation of POSIX regexp takes more than 4,000 lines of code. This is bigger than all Lua standard libraries together. In comparison, the implementation of pattern matching in Lua has less than 500 lines. Of course, the pattern matching in Lua cannot do all that a full POSIX implementation does. Nevertheless, pattern matching in Lua is a powerful tool and includes some features that are difficult to match with standard POSIX implementations.

### Offset and exact in nvim-cmp

```

```

The `offset` comparator prefers `source1` candidates.

The `exact` comparator prefers `exact match` candidates.

1. Exact match
   - The user input is `word` and candidates text is `word`
2. Not exact match
   - The user input is `word` and candidates text is `wording`

### Motivation behind git patch

### What is the difference between git am and git apply?

Both the input and output are different:

- [`git apply`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-apply) takes a patch (e.g. the output of [`git diff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)) and applies it to the working directory (or index, if `--index` or `--cached` is used), **which means it won't commit automatically, even won't add it if you use the default option.**
- [`git am`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-am) takes a mailbox of commits formatted as an email messages (e.g. the output of [`git format-patch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/format-patch)) and applies them to the current branch.

[`git am` uses `git apply` behind the scenes](https://github.com/git/git/blob/bbcefff/git-am.sh#L151), but does more work before (reading a `Maildir` or `mbox`, and parsing email messages) and after (creating commits).

While the time-frame is open for the development of the next *major*, the -rcN suffix is used to identify the n'th *release candidate* for the next version.[[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-:2-40) For example, the release of the version 4.16 was preceded by seven 4.16-rcN (from -rc1 to -rc7). Once a stable release is made, its maintenance is passed off to the “stable team". Occasional updates to stable releases are identified by a three numbering scheme (e.g., 4.13.1, 4.13.2, …, 4.13.16).

neovim 也有自己的标记语言了，码住以后说不定会用上，可以用来记笔记什么的，就是目前还没有办法支持 pandoc 转成 markdown，所以估计还是没有办法放到博客上。
