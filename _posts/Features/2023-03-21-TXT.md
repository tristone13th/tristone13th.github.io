# Terminologies

### SMX

The SMX (Safer Mode Extension) are the processor’s **programming interface** in an Intel TXT platform.

### CE

The **controlling environment** is provided by system software such as an OS kernel or Virtual Machine Manager (VMM).

### MLE

The software launched using the SMX instructions is known as the **Measured Launched Environment (MLE)**. According to the definition, BIOS is included indeed.

### Measurement

The object of a measurement is a software.

Measuring **software** involves processing the executable such that the result (a) is unique and (b) indicates changes in the executable. A cryptographic hash algorithm meets these needs.

### DR

### 静态信任根（static Root of trust）

### 动态信任根（dynamic Root of trust）

# Motivation

A central objective of the Intel® TXT platform is to provide a measurement of the launched execution environment.
